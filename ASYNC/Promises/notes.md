* Promises is a construction function for object where it require the resolve/reject condition and then attaches the resolve d

* Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of Async operation and its resulting value
 - my defination, promise basically excepts an asyn operation and also excepts CB function in then()

* Yes, exactly! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how promises work in JavaScript, highlighting the key points about the promise's states and how it handles asynchronous operations:

### How Promises Work in JavaScript:

1. **Promise Creation and Immediate Return**:
   - When you create a new promise using `new Promise(executor)`, the JavaScript engine executes the `executor` function synchronously.
   - The promise immediately returns an object with a `pending` state. This object is an instance of `Promise`.

2. **Executor Function**:
   - The `executor` function is called with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`.
   - These functions are used to update the promise’s state once the asynchronous operation completes.

3. **Pending State**:
   - Initially, the promise is in the `pending` state, indicating that the asynchronous operation is still ongoing and neither fulfilled nor rejected.

4. **Asynchronous Operation**:
   - Inside the executor function, you typically start an asynchronous operation, such as a network request or a timer.
   - The result of this operation will determine how the promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected).

5. **State Transition**:
   - **Fulfilled**: When the `resolve` function is called, the promise transitions to the `fulfilled` state and the value passed to `resolve` is stored as the result of the promise.
   - **Rejected**: When the `reject` function is called, the promise transitions to the `rejected` state and the reason passed to `reject` is stored as the error of the promise.

6. **Handling Results**:
   - Once the promise transitions from `pending` to `fulfilled` or `rejected`, any attached `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `.finally()` handlers are scheduled to execute asynchronously.
   - These handlers are placed in the **microtask queue** to be processed by the JavaScript event loop.

### Key Points about Promises:

- **Synchronous Creation**:
  - The promise object is returned immediately, and it starts in the `pending` state.
  - The executor function runs synchronously to set up the asynchronous operation.

- **State Transition**:
  - A promise can be in one of three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`.
  - The transition from `pending` to either `fulfilled` or `rejected` is managed by the `resolve` and `reject` functions provided to the executor.

- **Asynchronous Handling**:
  - The actual asynchronous operation runs in the background, managed by the JavaScript runtime.
  - Once the operation completes, the promise’s state is updated, and the appropriate handlers are queued for execution.

### Example of a Promise in Action:

Consider the following example:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("Promise executor starts");

  // Simulate an asynchronous operation using setTimeout
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Fulfill the promise with a result after 1 second
    resolve("Operation successful");
  }, 1000);

  // Uncomment the following line to simulate a rejection
  // setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Operation failed")), 1000);
});

console.log(promise); // Logs the initial promise in the pending state

promise
  .then(result => {
    console.log("Promise fulfilled with result:", result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Promise rejected with error:", error);
  });

console.log("Promise created and waiting for resolution");
```

**Output Explanation**:

1. **Synchronous Execution**:
   - `console.log("Promise executor starts")` runs immediately.
   - The promise is created in the `pending` state and is logged as such.

2. **Asynchronous Operation**:
   - The `setTimeout` function simulates a 1-second delay before fulfilling the promise with `resolve("Operation successful")`.
   - If the rejection line were uncommented, it would reject the promise after 1 second.

3. **State Update**:
   - After 1 second, `resolve("Operation successful")` is called, transitioning the promise to the `fulfilled` state.
   - The promise's `.then()` handler is added to the microtask queue to be processed once the current call stack is clear.

4. **Handler Execution**:
   - The `.then()` handler runs, logging `Promise fulfilled with result: Operation successful`.

### Summary:

- A promise is created and returned in the `pending` state immediately.
- The `executor` function, which may start asynchronous operations, runs synchronously during promise creation.
- The promise's state is updated to `fulfilled` or `rejected` based on the outcome of the asynchronous operation.
- Handlers attached with `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `.finally()` are executed asynchronously once the promise's state is updated and the current call stack is cleared.
