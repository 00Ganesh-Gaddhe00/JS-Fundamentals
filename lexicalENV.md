When the outer function in JavaScript completes execution and is no longer in use, the memory occupied by its lexical environment can be released or "garbage collected." However, if there are any inner functions (closures) that reference variables from the outer function's lexical environment, that environment will be retained in memory as long as those inner functions are accessible.

Detailed Explanation:
Lexical Environment and Closures:

When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure. The inner function retains access to the variables in the outer function's lexical environment even after the outer function has completed execution.
This is because the inner function's lexical environment includes a reference to the outer function's lexical environment (the outer environment reference).
Garbage Collection and Memory Management:

JavaScript's garbage collector reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable or referenced.
If an outer function's lexical environment is no longer needed (i.e., no references to it exist), it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
Preservation of Lexical Environment by Closures:

If an inner function (closure) that was created inside the outer function is still accessible (e.g., stored in a variable or passed around), it maintains a reference to the outer function's lexical environment.
This reference prevents the garbage collector from reclaiming the memory used by the outer function's lexical environment because it is still in use by the inner function.
