* The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript refers to the period between the time a variable is scoped (created in memory) and the time it is initialized (assigned a value). During this period, the variable cannot be accessed, and attempting to do so will result in a ReferenceError.

This concept primarily applies to variables declared with the let and const keywords, as they have block-level scoping and are not hoisted in the same way as var.


-where we run the JavaScript code a global Execution context is created, 
-which 2 phase called memory phase and execution phase, 
-during memory phase a memory or space for declared variables and functions is created, a global object which consist of javascript properties and API gets attached 
and during exection phase the code will be Executed 
- when we invoke a function another functional execution context is created which works similar 

* hoisting : the behaviour of variables and functions that can be accessed before declaring then in the form of hoisting,
              because the memory is already allocated in the memoryphase before code execution in executing phase due to which the varaibale and functions are hoisted

             - Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the function name and its definition are moved to the top of the scope.
             - Variables declared with var are hoisted, but they are initialized to undefined until the line of code where the initialization occurs.
             - Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) and cannot be accessed until the execution reaches their declaration.

* lexical scope : Lexical Environment
The lexical environment is the structure that JavaScript internally creates to track variables within a scope. Every time a function is executed, a new lexical environment is created.

Each lexical environment has two components:
- Environment Record: This is where variable and function declarations are stored.
- Outer Lexical Environment: This refers to the lexical environment of the outer function (or global scope) where the function is defined.


* closures : In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This is because a closure is created when a function is defined within another function, and the inner function maintains a reference to the lexical environment of the outer function.
        
        1. Data Encapsulation / Private Variables
        Closures allow you to create "private" variables that can't be accessed directly from outside the function but can be modified through the inner function. This helps in creating more secure and encapsulated code.

        Example:    function createCounter() {
                      let count = 0;  // Private variable

                        return function() {
                      count++;  // Modify private variable
                        return count;
                           };
                      }

                   const counter = createCounter();

                    console.log(counter());  // Output: 1
                    console.log(counter());  // Output: 2
                     console.log(counter());  // Output: 3

      3. Event Handlers and Callbacks
         In asynchronous programming (e.g., event handlers or callbacks), closures allow the function to retain access to variables in the surrounding scope even after the asynchronous operation has completed.

      4. Currying
        Closures are essential in currying, a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is broken down into a series of functions, each taking one argument at a time. Currying enables more flexible and reusable function calls.

       * Summary of Applications of closures:
           - Data encapsulation (creating private variables).
            - Function factories (creating customized functions).
           - Event handlers and asynchronous callbacks (preserving access to variables in delayed actions).
          - Currying (partial application of functions).
          - Memoization (performance optimization via caching).
          - Module pattern (creating public APIs with private data).
          - Stateful functions (preserving state across function calls).


* currying : Currying is a technique in functional programming that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
             Instead of taking all arguments at once, a curried function takes the first argument and returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments have been provided.
const name = ganesh = name is inheriting from string, string is inheriting from object
       
* Prototype ; is basically an object made out of construction fxn or inbuilt that defines the characters of an instance using its properties and functions. the javascript like arrays, fxns attached a fxn prototype along with the object 
 if obj2.__proto__ = gives the prototype of it which = object.prototype

 function Parent() {
    this.name = "Parent";
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);
};

function Child() {
    Parent.call(this);  // Inherit properties from Parent
    this.name = "Child";
}

Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);  // Inherit methods from Parent
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

let childInstance = new Child();
childInstance.greet();  // Output: "Hello, I am Child"


 prototype inheritence = obj2.__proto__ = obj1 = not advisible(immaturly update) = cause performance issues go through all unwanted obj1 props/inherents all peroperties even unwanted one/ can modify each others props
 instead use construnctor fxns and methods so that js do it properly


example when we creat an array, array properties and fxns of that to which array prototype to which object prototypes, everything in javascript is nothing but an object
__proto_ is property of any variable that is pointing towards the parent that its inheriting from

* Protype inheritence : inheriting properties and fxn from one constructor object to another or adding properties and fxn to the constructor object

* protype chaining : when we inherit 

Prototypal inheritence concept is defferent from class inheritence

1. Prototype
Definition: In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object by default. It serves as a template from which other objects can inherit properties and methods. 
Each JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which is a reference to another object (its prototype). This prototype can itself have a prototype, creating a chain of prototypes.

2. Prototype Inheritance
Definition: Prototype inheritance is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows an object to inherit properties and methods from another object via the prototype chain. 
This means that if an object does not have a property or method, JavaScript will look for it in the object's prototype.

3. Prototype Chaining
Definition: Prototype chaining is the mechanism by which JavaScript looks up properties and methods in the prototype chain. When an object is created, it has a link to its prototype, and if a property or method is not found on the object itself, 
JavaScript will look in its prototype. If it is not found there, it will continue to look up the prototype chain until it reaches Object.prototype, which is at the top of the chain.

Method shadowing in JavaScript refers to the phenomenon where a derived or child object has a method that has the same name as a method in its prototype or parent object. When this happens, 
the child object's method "shadows" or overrides the method in the parent object, making the parent method inaccessible from the child instance.
